## Web Project (AI-Generated)

This is a simple web project created using **HTML, CSS, and JavaScript**.

The website was generated by creating a **prompt and providing it to an AI**, which produced the complete structure, styling, and functionality.

### How to Run the Project
1. Download or clone the repository
2. Keep all files (`.html`, `.css`, `.js`) inside the same folder
3. Open the `.html` file in any web browser
4. The website will run locally on your machine

### Note
This project demonstrates how AI can be used to quickly generate functional web applications using prompts.
It takes me hardly 10 minutes to write this Prompt
